  The Field Museum of Natural History, also known as The Field Museum, is a natural history museum in 
            Chicago, Illinois, and is one of the largest such museums in the world.

            Water Tower Place is a large urban, mixed-use development comprising a 758,000 sq ft shopping mall, hotel, theater, 
            and condominiums in a 74-story skyscraper in Chicago, Illinois, United States. 
            The mall is located at 835 North Michigan Avenue, along the Magnificent Mile.

  Water Tower complies with all state and local mandates related to COVID-19, including but not limited to reduced capacity, dining restrictions, and face coverings (where applicable).<br>
             These restrictions are the most up-to-date and take precedence over the industry-specific guidelines if there are points of contradiction
